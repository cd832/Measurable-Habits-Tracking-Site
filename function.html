    <h2>Habits List</h2>
    <p>
    You are welcomed by your <b>habits list</b>, list that's kept forever in your browser's local memory.
    </p>
    <p>
    On your habits list, next to your hobby's name, you can click the progress button to generate the number input textbox, in order to add time to your hobby whcih has not been tracked using <a href="timers.html">browser's timers.html</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Next to the habit's progress button is a trash icon button. Click it to simply delete the hobby and its' recorded data.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sort Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
    Using <a src="/int/history.html">history.html</a>'s history sort feature I designed this: a better way to sort your hobbies if you have <s>ADHD</s> a variety of beautiful interests.
    </p>
    <p>You can either gray out the items at the bottom of the list/those that do not fit your criteria, or hide them entirely.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Add New Hobby</h2>
    <p>To create a new habit, click on the text field below your hobbies' list and input your new hobby's name, as well as the frequency.
    </p>
    <p>Four options are available:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Daily</b></li>
      <li><b>Weekly:</b> Choose the days on which you want to do this hobby.</li>
      <li><b>Monthly:</b> This is a feature designed for me, but you can use it too. Pick between odd, even days, or select a singular date on which you want to do your hobby.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Done? Then click the <b>add habit</b> button.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Clear All Button</h2>
    <p>
    The "Delete All Habits" or clear all button allows you to delete all your inputed habits, along their progress history.
    </p>
    <p>
    Do note: <b>Recordings older than 30 days are automatically deleted</b>. If you worry about clutter, just let a month pass by, and you can keep your hobbies. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If you clear your browser's cookies for neocities, your hobbies will all be deleted.
    </p>
    
    <h1>timers.html</h1>
    <h2>Timer Section</h2>
    <p>
    From the dropdown menu, select the hobby you want to track, then click start timer.
    </p>
    <p>You can exit the app freely, as long as your browser has the permission to run in the background. Your progress will still be tracked. <i>(still testing this)</i>
    </p>
    
    <h1>graph.html</h1>
    <h2>Pie Graph</h2>
    
    <p>The pie graph automatically shows the % of time you spent on hobby a, in comparison with hobby b. While unfinished, the idea showcasts a great method of tracking productivity and how your actions are spread across the day, month, or week, and is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/adrcotfas/Goodtime">goodtime pomodoro tracker</a>
    
    <h2>XoY Graph</h2>
    
    <p>Not even sure how to name it. This idea is unfinished and doesn't work yet, despite my, AI's and StackOverflow's help.
    </p>
    
    <h1>history.html</h1>
    <h2>Sort History</h2>
    <p>
    Did you see the hobby sort list thing in index.html?
    </p>
    <p>
    It's back, and better.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can use it to see your monthly, daily, weekly data up to 30 days of age. Everything older than <b>30 days will be deleted within that file</b>.
    </p>
    
    <h1><a href="original.html">original.html</a></h1>
    <h2><a href="original.html">Original Site</a></h2>
    <p>
    For people that do not like the current clutter, you can get the better clutter, the original, less-advanced, alpha version.
    </p>
    <p>
    Be warned: <b>The old productivity button does not work.</b> It was replaced by a different mechanism in the script.js file.
