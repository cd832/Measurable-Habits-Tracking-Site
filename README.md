# MetHabit
> A simple measurable habits tracking website. Made with the help of AI, hence why it's free to use, and I don't care what you do with it. Created for myself, shared for those who find it useful for themselves.

## What is this?
This is a simple web application designed by me with the sole help of Le Chat AI for my routines. As I wrote my 400th line of JavaScript code, I thought I should share it as well with the world.
